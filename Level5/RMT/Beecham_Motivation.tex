\subsection{Motivation of Software Engineering} 
% Number of papers, Kitchenham method 
\citet*{Beecham2007} reviews how motivation affects the process of software engineering. Specifically, the study assesses how software engineers might me mtivated or unmotivated, and what factors cause this to happen on a personal level. It also assesses what properties software engineers tend to have, and what models of motivation exist in software engineering.\par

This study followed the Kitchenham guidelines for conducting their review. With five research questions answered over the course of the paper, the research is involved and lengthy --- however, no statistical analysis is produced. Instead, it uses representations of the collated research, alongside counts of traits of software engineers in the various studies. Kitchenham's guidelines are lauded in part for their rigour and repeatability. While this research contained both, the lack of data to analyse and semantic nature of the findings means that a repeatability study may not hold much value. Together with the many visual aids presented, this review may have benefited from techniques in Webster's method, which was was similar to in nature (yet systematic).\par
