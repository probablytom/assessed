\subsection{Automated Analyses of Feature Models}
\citet*{Benavides} performs a review of techniques used for automating the analysis of a feature model. The review is an interesting blend of Kitchenham's systematic approach and the more semantic (yet structured) approach of Webster's guidelines. In doing this, \citeauthor{Benavides} produce a rigorous review which also persitently focuses on making its findings accessible to the reader, though data visualisation and detailing the non-quantitative findings of the review.\par

\citeauthor{Benavides} detail their effective research method as well as three research questions, which are closely examined. They also detail their inclusion and exclusion criteria for their search, enabling the repeatability of the systematic review. \par

The authors conclude their research, having assessed the state-of-the-art in the field and observing the current research trends, with an exposition as to future challenges the field may face. Unfortunately, the majority of their results are visualisation and discussion as opposed to statistical analysis, as per Kitchenham's method. These visualisations are however created in such a way that their review may be repeated and similarities observed, meaning that some degree of repeatability is still present.\par
