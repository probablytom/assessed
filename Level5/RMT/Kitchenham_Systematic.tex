\subsection{A Systematic Review of Systematic Reviews}
A final paper worth noting for the purposes of this review is Kitchenham's own systematic review of published systematic reviews \citep{Kitchenham2013}. The review by \citeauthor*{Kitchenham2013} is very thorough, and includes research questions, search criteria, and all other characteristic traits of a systematic review.\par

This review excluded papers to a pool of 45 from an original sample of 410. Like other reviewed papers, this review creates taxonomies and identifies key traits of a review through textual analysis rather than statistical analysis. However, the review also includes statistical analyses of these taxonomies, provided statistics such as Kappa calculations. It is the only paper reviewed to do so.\par

This paper selects papers with appropriate impacts and represents the state of the art in systematic reviews very effectively. In concluding the review, the authors highlight some concerns with current review procedure, as well a concerns with current guidelines and best practices, offering constructive criticism of changes to their own work and others in light of their findings. It also calls for further research into systematic reviews, and for better tooling to improve the issues they identify, which include ceasing to mention data extrators and checkers and to mention citation-based search strategies.\par
