Systematic reviewing is a technique for bringing scientific rigour to a computer science literature review, pioneered by Barbara Kitchenham~\citep{Kitchenham2004}. Specifically, Kitchenham's systematic reviews utilise concepts from the field of medical research to create literature reviews which are repeatable, and produce statistical and empirical results. The technique is posited as a tool for software engineering research. 12 years after Kitchenham's original guidelines were set for structuring a systematic literature review, the technique has seen widespread adoption --- but the original guidelines raise questions and note possible issues with the method. With a wide set of samples to choose from, a review of these systematic reviews may highlight whether these concerns are worth revisiting, before Kitchenham's guidelines --- or other methods derived from them --- become standard practice for the software engineering research community.
