\subsection{Effect Size in Software Engineering}
One review to note is~\citet*{Kampenes2007} --- a review indicating it follows Kitchenham's guidelines and citing the paper, though never stating it outright. The search criteria used (which is necessary for a systematic review to note) was cited from another paper however (\cite{Sjoberg2005}, which shares some authors), rather than stated directly; the collated work was a set of software engineering papers exhibiting controlled experiments published over the span of 10 years.\par

The method for data extraction was well reported, as a systematic review should entail by Kitchenham's guidelines. The paper goes on to perform a deep and thorough statistical analysis, and concludes with a review of the results of these analyses with a comparison to the results of similar papers in Psychology and Behavioural Science. The paper succeeded in selecting several papers with empirical data so as to perform the statistical analysis with a large sample. The authors found 78 usable studies for their review, from the 5453 studies assessed. Happily, the researchers found quantitative data on which to perform some statistical analysis.\par
