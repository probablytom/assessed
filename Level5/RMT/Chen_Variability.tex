\subsection{Variability Management in Software Product Lines}
\citet*{Chen2007} review the field of Variability Management according to Kitchenham's guidelines. While there have been other literature reviews in the field, this systematic review is the first to rigorously assess it.\par

\citeauthor{Chen2007} select 34 papers from an original sample of 628. While the procedure to collect the original 628 is unclear, their inclusion and exclusion criteria from that point forward are well documented. In terms of adherence to systematic review guidelines, \citeauthor{Chen2007} do not succeed in producing a model or developing statistical inferences from the data produced. However, they do perform a textual analysis to create a repeatable assessment of the current state-of-the-art in Variability Management.\par

The paper also summarises problems with current literature: only a handful of publications studied tackled important issues such as scalability and testing. No mention of inspection and review as quality assurance techniques were observed by the authors. In this way, while no statistical analysis was completed, the authors successfully assess the current state of the literature and provide many points of potential improvement for researchers in the area.\par
